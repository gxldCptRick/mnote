# mnote

This is my own implementation of a whiteboard application similar to onenote. it does the basics of onenote by that i mean you can draw on the board and annotate drawings but it has limited features in order to make drawing easier.
This is written with Java and specifically using the JavaFX libraries and only the JavaFX libraries.
